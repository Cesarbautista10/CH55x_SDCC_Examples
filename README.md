# CH552_Getting_Started

This course focuses on describing a method to install and complement using different code examples. The main goal is to generate documentation for all individuals. This documentation requires an advanced or intermediate level of application for embedded systems and the application of various examples that allow advancement in the topic. It is necessary to read all the information and apply it to specific situations. This course aims to help you understand how to compile a project using advanced tools, based on more advanced microcontroller platforms.

## Requirements

- Python Proficiency (Package Installation and Environments)
- Utilization of Operating System Controllers
- Understanding of Basic Electronics

You can read the documentation about the architecture of 8051 applied in CH552, an 8-bit microcontroller that includes embedded USB, making it an excellent option for projects with good purposes and low cost.
